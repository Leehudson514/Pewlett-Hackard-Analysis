# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis
## Overview of the analysis
* The purpose of this analysis was to determine the number of retiring employees per title, and identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program using pgAdmin and SQL.
* The client tasked us with "future-proofing the company by determining how many people will be retiring and, of those employees, who is eligible for a retirement package."
## Results: 
* Task: Determine The Number of Retiring Employees by Title
    *   The largest groups about to retire are employees with the title "Senior Engineer" and "Senior Staff".
    *   These "Senior" title holders make up 70% of the retirees.
